<h1 id="title">The City</h1>

<P>Your knees bear the scars of home.</p>
<p>Your knees have no scars.</p>
<p>You are stuck in this place with no options.</p>
<p>You are obligated to love it.</p>
<p>Your palace is too big to call home.</p>
<p>Your thoughts have become simplistic, feral hopes of escape.</p>
<p>Your days haunt you with their monotony...</p>
<p>Monotony...</p>
<p>Monotony...</p>
<p>Monotony...</p>
<p>The bedroom on the fifth floor to the right has been yours since the day you were born. It has sat as a welcoming space. A bed with a cloth top sat in the corner. It was made perfectly and drenched in the clean smell of soap. The ceiling was made of dark wood beams. The walls were draped in elegant wallpaper. A matching desk and hand-embroidered tuffet were next to the bed. The desk held a quill with thick, blue ink. A piece of blank paper taunted anyone who stared too long. The only sound that could be heard was an unidentifiable bird singing to itself. A comfort that costs an early morning. Its overwhelming incense with strong, floral tones has been the same for many years. The smell creates nausea in most. But the flat smell of grass outside drowns out the smell, making it bearable for few. On top of it all, sat a large window framing the unreachable town in all its glory.</p>
<p>The town was full of large, brownish structures with red accents. Steep, snow-covered mountains marked the borders. They were jagged and much larger than a life lived in the palace. It has seen the creation of success and the ultimate, untimely fate of suffering. Stratocumulus-esque clouds often sat above these peaks. Gorgeous hills and tall trees swept throughout. The town had many steps and small mud homes covered with dried grass. These alluring features have only doubled in the past few years.</p>
<p>Your palace is furnished with selfish thoughts. You are compelled to leave your castle.</p>
