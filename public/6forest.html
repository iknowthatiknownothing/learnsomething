<h1>Love</h1>

<p>The garden was decorated in beautiful trees bearing large fruits and delicious vegetables found all over. They were always a reliable source of delicious food. The ground was covered in continuous green grass. The weather was alway sunny and warm. To the point where you can feel the sun touch your skin but doesn't bite. The garden held a sweet smell and the citrus tree's mixed smell made a wonderful aroma. With the trees, came a large population of animals. There were birds of all different species, insects from small to large, and many types of rodents that roamed the ground. They made all unique sounds and tracks. In the middle ran a babbling creek filled with fish and cold, clean water. It was a soundtrack that fit well with the environment. This garden was as big as the eye could see.</p>

<p>They have always told me the rules and what to believe. It's been easy. As long as you follow their three expectations, life is perfect. You follow them because of the threats and uncertainty of the outside world. Or at least what your head drums it up to be.

<p>We have never seen the creators of this garden. To pass the time, we made up their appearances and backgrounds. We imagined them to be beautiful deities with long hair and billowing clothing. They would float down and admire their sacred bill. The bill prominently sat in the garden's center.

<p>It said in perfect lettering:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Always follow the rules</li>
    <li>Never question them or us</li>
    <li>Believe what we tell you to believe</li>
</ul>

</p>I will never leave. There have been people that considered it and never came back. I have not decided this but the creators have. I don't want to go even if I did have the choice because life outside is too hard. Trusting the unknown is hard, but easier than trusting myself. There are many steps to making a decision and here is like a continuous vacation for the brain. Of course, I have never seen outside. But then again, I trust them. They have never done any to harm me or the other residences. They have provided us with food, water, and anything that we could possibly need. I have never had a good reason not to trust them.</p>
