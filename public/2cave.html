<h1 id="title">The Cave</h1>

<p class="subTitle">By Vee</p>

<p>There is a cave where people have been imprisoned since they were children. These prisoners are chained by their legs and necks to the wall. This forced them to face the wall in front of the cave. They couldn’t look at any other part of the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire. People who aren’t prisoners cast shadows and make sounds. The prisoners believe these sounds are the shadows talking. These shadows are the reality for the prisoners because they don’t know anything else. Since they can’t see behind their back, they do not know the shadows are just shadows.</p>

<p>Many believe that if the prisoners were freed, they would continue to believe the lies of the cave. Let’s say a man was taught the truth and later freed from the cave. The light from the fire would hurt his eyes. This would make it difficult for him to see the objects and people creating the shadows. He wouldn't believe it if he were told that the fire and the objects were real, not the shadows. Most likely the freed prisoner would turn away and keep watching the shadows. He would escape the harsh reality by turning away from the things he could look at and understand. He would believe that the shadows are more understandable than the truth. For them it was the most explainable at the moment.</p>

<p>If the prisoner were to be dragged out, he would go through a slow progression of adapting to the real world. His eyes would first adjust to the light of the sun. This can allow him only to see shadows. Gradually he can see the reflections of people and things in water. This continues with the ability to see people and things themselves. Eventually, he can look at the stars, moon, and the sun. Of course, he will come back and tell the others about what he saw. He would pity them as they are unable to escape. Little does he know that they do not wish to be freed. The shadows are all they have ever known and they are unaware of the splendor of the outside world. The returning prisoner's eyes would have become accustomed to the light. The darkness would be blinding when he re-entered the cave. The prisoners would assume that the journey had harmed him and that the outside was harmful. Many assumed that the prisoners would never leave.</p>
