<h1 id="title">The Garden</h1>

<p class="subTitle">By Vee</p>

<p>The garden is adorned with beautiful trees bearing large fruits and delicious vegetables found all over. They are always a reliable source of food. The ground is covered in lush, green grass that stretches continuously. The weather is always sunny and warm, just enough for you to feel the sun touch your skin without it being too harsh. The garden carries a sweet fragrance, with the mixed scent of citrus trees creating a wonderful aroma.</p>

<p>With the trees comes a large population of animals. There are birds of various species, insects ranging from small to large, and many types of rodents roaming the ground. They all make unique sounds and leave distinct tracks. In the middle of the garden, a babbling creek runs, filled with fish and cold, clean water. Its soothing sound complements the peaceful environment. This garden stretches as far as the eye can see.</p>

<p>We have never seen the creators of this garden. To pass the time, we imagine their appearances and backgrounds. We envision them as beautiful deities with long hair and billowing clothing. They float down and admire their sacred bill, which prominently sits at the garden's center.</p>

<p>It states in perfect lettering:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Always follow the rules.</li>
    <li>Never question the rules.</li>
    <li>The rules let us prosper.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will never leave. There have been people who simply considered it and never came back. Leaving is against the rules set by the creators. I hear that life outside is hard. Trusting the unknown is difficult, but it's easier than trusting myself. I cannot imagine a life outside the garden; imagination feels pointless. Making decisions takes too much effort, and here decisions are made for you. It is like a continuous vacation for the brain.</p>

<p>I have never seen the outside. But then again, I trust the creators. They have never done anything to harm me or the other residents. They have provided us with food, water, and everything we could possibly need. I have never had a good reason not to trust them.</p>

<p>But... what are these thoughts I am having?</p>
